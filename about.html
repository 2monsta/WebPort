            Hello world, my name is Yunfei Li. My background is in finance but soon realized that finance is not what i really wanted to do in life. After i landed in my first job that i fell in love with coding. I started out with just some simple SQL statements but soon after, it opened up a whole new world for me. 
        	</p>
        	<p id="paragraph1"> 
            After a couple of month of doing research and see how our development team at my first company worked, it became obvious that coding is something i want to do with my life. I started out with freecodecamp, udemy, codeacademy but then decided to pursue a higher education. I'm currently enrolled at Kennesaw State University(KSU) for their Master's software engineering degree. After attending a semester at KSU, i feel like the speed was not up to my needs, as in i want to learn a little bit faster due to the fact that i want to start working in the industry as soon as i can which led me to attend a coding bootcamp.
